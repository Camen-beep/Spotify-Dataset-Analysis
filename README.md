# 🎵 Spotify Songs Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a practice project inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bynsxAbjImQ), using a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geomack/spotifyclassification) to perform basic data analysis on Spotify songs.

The analysis focuses on:  
- The dataset creator’s favorite artists and songs  
- Musical features of the related tracks (e.g., *danceability*, *energy*, *tempo*, etc.)  

This project is designed for those who want to practice **music data analysis** and **Python-based data processing**.
